1. In certain programming languages the source code is not directly translated by the target
machine. Instead, a different program, called the ____interpreter_____, reads and executes the code.
This is called an ___interpreted_____ language.

2. Type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to
change over its lifetime, this is called ____dynamic____ typing.

3. The automatic conversion of values from one data type to another is called ____Type Juggling/Type Coercion_____.

4. ___Non-primitive___ are mutable and hold references to objects stored in memory.


5. __strict_____ Checks if two values are equal without type coercion.
