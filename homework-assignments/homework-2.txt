They both can be used to point to an id/class name in a style sheet. The difference is id attributes must have a unique value within the HTML document. Whereas class attributes can have mulitiple HTML elements sharing the same class. 

2. What are the parts of a CSS rule?

A CSS rule has 2 parts, a selector and a declaration. CSS selectors are used to find the HTML elements you want to style. Declarations are inside curly brackets and have a property and value that when applied creates a visual effect.

3. Explain how CSS rules cascade.

CSS rules cascade based on which takes precedence. The important key word rules over anything. The element with the highest specificity will win when more than 1 CSS rule points to the same element. Inheritance - a child element will gain the properties from its parent element. Lastly, if more than 1 CSS rile points to the same element the rule that is applied last wins.
