HTML elements are building blocks of webpages by representing headings, paragraphs, links, and images. It is a collection of start and end tags with content inserted between them. HTML tags act like containers; an opening tag, i.e., <h1>, and a closing tag has a forward slash, i.e., </h1>. Tags transform the content enclosed in them. Attributes tell more about the content of elements; they have a name and value.

Semantic elements are intended to convey meaning by their element type, even if the element is indistinguishable from other elements visually. Structural elements with meaning have an effect on the structure of a page but donâ€™t necessarily convey any meaning by their element type.
